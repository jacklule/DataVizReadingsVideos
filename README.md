# DataVizReadingsVideos
I am hoping this can be a shared repository in which students review data viz readings and videos. My reasoning is two-fold:
- The number of readings and videos on data visualization is staggering. It would be great to have students annotate and review this wealth of literature;
- If each student is contributing to the repository, submitting and committing changes, we will be using the collaborative potential that has made GitHub such a resource for those working on coding.
