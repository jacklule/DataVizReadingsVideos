# DataVizReadingsVideos
I am hoping this [Annotated List](https://github.com/jacklule/DataVizReadingsVideos/blob/master/AnnotatedDataViz.md) can be a shared repository in which students review data viz readings and videos. My reasoning is two-fold:
- The number of readings and videos on data visualization is staggering. It would be great to have students annotate and review this wealth of literature;
- As Melody Kramer says in her fine, [Learning GitHub Without One Line of Code](http://melodykramer.github.io/2015/04/06/learning-github-without-one-line-of-code/), an excellent way to learn the collaborative nature of GitHub is to contribute to a repository. If each student contributes to the repository, with changes and issues submitted, committed, pulled and merged, we will be grasping the collaborative potential that has made GitHub such a good tool for those working on coding and other group projects.
