# DataVizReadingsVideos
I am hoping this can be a shared repository in which students review data viz readings and videos. My reasoning is two-fold:
- The number of readings and videos on data visualization is staggering. It would be great to have students annotate and review this wealth of literature;
- If each student is contributing to the repository, with changes and issues submitted, committed, pulled and merged, we will be using the collaborative potential that has made GitHub such a good tool for those working on coding and other grour projects. 

As Melody Kramer says in her fine, [Learning GitHub Without One Line of Code](http://melodykramer.github.io/2015/04/06/learning-github-without-one-line-of-code/), an excellent way to learn the collaborative nature of GitHub is to contribute to a repository.

I would thus like students to contribute to a kind of annotated bibliography of data visualization resources.
