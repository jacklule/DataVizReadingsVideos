Borrowing from Melody Kramer's, excellent [Learning GitHub Without One Line of Code](http://melodykramer.github.io/2015/04/06/learning-github-without-one-line-of-code/), here are instructions on how to contribute to this list:

- If you are reading this page, you are likely logged into GitHub. If so, then merely click the fork button, which you will find on the top right corner of this page.
- In blue, you should now see your username /DataVizReadingsVideos, then underneath, that it was forked from jacklule. You're now ready to edit your own version of DataVizReadingsVideo, which you can then merge into the original once your edits are finished.True collaboration!
- On the top right side of the page, DataVizReadingsVideo, you should now see small icons in a horizontal row: a monitor, a pencil, and a trash. Click on the pencil to edit the page.
- As you likely know, this page is written in a language called markdown. The link to your video or presentation should thus be submitted as follows:
  - [Title of Content](link to content). Note where Video or Presentation or Article. Note length of video or number of slides or number of pages. Write a 200-word summary of the piece. End with one sentence of what you thought about the piece.
- Scroll down once you're finished with your edits. At the bottom of the page, there's a place to leave a comment about what you've done. This is optional.
Click "Commit directly to the Master branch." (Remember, this is still your version, not the original.)
When you go back to the main page for your version of PublicMedia, underneath the green button, you should see a little gray line that says the branch is some number of commits ahead of melodykramer:master. Directly right of that line, click the button for Pull Request.
Review your edits, and when they are ready, create your pull request.
